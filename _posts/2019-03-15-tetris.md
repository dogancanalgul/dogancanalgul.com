# Introduction

This is my first project. In the beginning, I started using Processing to visualize small game mechanics s.a. movement, jumping, and gravity. After a while, I decided to stop tinkering with Processing and create a game along the way. 

I choose Tetris because I once read making Tetris, Breakout, Pacman, and Mario teach you the cores of video games. So I started with Tetris and made it in 3 days. It taught me a lot about the first bits. 

# Process

I didn't know what is Javascript at the time. However, I didn't spend any time learning the language. I just learned what I need to do and used just that. That's why the code is not perfect. But used my OOP paradigm to create some object structure. 
First I researched Tetris itself and learned it has quite the lore. After my journey with tetrominos, I made my object structure as follows.

First There is the **Block** which made a square on the screen:

The second one is the **tetrominos** which is individual game pieces:

Last but not least there is **Game** which controls every game aspect:
