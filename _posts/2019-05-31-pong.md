# Introduction

This project is on baby steps. The sole purpose of this project is to create an environment for learning machine learning. Thus, I and my friend [Selman Ozleyen](https://github.com/SelmanOzleyen) created the Pong part to teach our machine learning scripts. Our tasks were simple and as follows:

- Pong Game
- Player vs Player 
- Player vs Bot created by our algorithm
- Player vs Bot created by machine learning
- Player vs Player over Internet

But before we moved to 3rd task at hand, we got carried on. My friend had a tight schedule for a long time. However, this is still on my todo list and I am planning on implementing it soon.

# Process

The Pong is made with python and pygame. Each user has its racket, scoreboard, and net to count the goals. 

Here is a screenshot from the game:

Here is a video of one of my test playthroughs:

Honestly, without the mentioned AI parts this project is not much. So stay tuned for updates and do not hesitate to contact me in any matter.
