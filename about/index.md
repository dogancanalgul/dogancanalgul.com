 <h1 > Who was I </h1>
On my 10th birthday, I have already planned to become a computer engineer. On my 16th birthday, I have already planned to become a part of a big game. I believe that will be how I will leave a mark on this world.

<h1> Who I want to be </h1> My career will be wrapped around the game industry. I want to be a game engine programmer. I am totally fine with continuing in another branch of game development. But in that case, I will still work on engines as a hobby.

# Now what  
These days in my life, I am searching for an entry point to the game industry. In the meantime, I am working on several projects that will make me more qualified for the entry point while scratching my curiosity itches on game development.
## Here is what I am doing these days:
- **Unity Game Development:** If you want to make a motor, you have to disassemble another motor. I am studying intermediate level Unity to;
    - make small games for game development experience in all areas of the game development process such as modeling level design, scripting.
    - learn how the subsystems of a game engine work. 
- **Orthrus:** A new rendering project. I will study **OpenGL** and **DirectX 11**. Orthrus is a 2 headed dog in Greek Mythology. I will learn graphics concepts using both OpenGL and Direct3D. This way I will be closer to industry standards.
- **Website:** I am having presentation difficulties when I am discussing who I am and what I do. Thus I am trying to improve my internet presence. I started with a basic website but more will come. 
- **Blender:** While using Blender, I am having the same thrill of creating things I have from game engines. I am not successfull much but it is fun. Also, it is good to know how to create assets for unity.
