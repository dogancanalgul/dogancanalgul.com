 <h1 > Who was I </h1>
By my 10th birthday, I decided to become a computer engineer. By my 16th birthday, I decided to be in computer graphics. I believe that will be how I will leave a mark on this world.

# Now what
These days in my life, I am searching for an entry point to the game industry. In the meantime, I am working on several projects that will make me more qualified for the entry point while scratching my curiosity itches on game development.
## Here is what I am doing these days:


- **Web Application as a WebAR Engine**: This was one of my two big university projects. Simply put, I designed a 3D editor with webGL on Unity to make webAR projects on web. The resultant webAR projects are just one html file using the  [a-frame](https://aframe.io/)'s 3D engine and [AR.js](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/)'s a-frame support for AR parts. I continue developing it in my spare time.

- **Unity Game Development:** Best way to make a motor is by disassembling another one. I am practicing Unity to;
    - make small games for game development experience in all areas of the game development process such as modeling, level design, scripting.
    - learn how the subsystems of a game engine work.

- **Orthrus:** A new rendering project. I will study **OpenGL** and **DirectX 11**. Orthrus is a 2 headed dog in Greek Mythology. I will learn graphics concepts using both OpenGL and Direct3D. This way I will be closer to industry standards.

- **Website:** I am trying to improve my internet presence. I started with a basic static website on github. For now I am learning the code I am running. In time, I will better tailor it for my taste.

- **Blender:** While using Blender, I am having the same thrill of creating things I have from game engines. I am not very good at it but I have fun. Also, it is a good shortcut to create assets for Unity.
