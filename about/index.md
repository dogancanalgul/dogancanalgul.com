			<h1 > Who was I </h1>
			I love learning different aspects of Computer Science. Thus, I spent my university years trying out many fields. In my 4 years, I learned the following PLs, programs, and libraries in different capacities: Assembly (x86), C, C++ (17), C# (8.0), Java (15), Common Lisp, Verilog, Python (3.8), JavaScript, CSS, HTML5;
			UE4, UE5, Unity, Blender, Pygame, libGDX, TensorFlow, .Net, Spring Framework with ThymeLeaf, React, Node.js, p5.js.<br>
			All of that was to help me become a better developer for the gaming industry like a cook travelling around the world for different cuisines or a fighter learning different martial arts to be a better fighter. And I think it worked.

			<h1> Who I want to be </h1>
			I got a great start so far. I want to continue on my current career path while learning and trying out more fields of game development and computer science. I believe that would help me be a better developer and	expand my effectiveness in a wider team.

			And as a hobbyist, I will continue the path of a game developer, a 3D artist and an animator.

## Here is what I am doing these days:

- **UE5 Game Development:** Best way to make a motor is by disassembling another one. I am practicing UE5 to;
	- make small games for game development experience in all areas of the game development process such as modeling, level design, scripting, sound and graphics.
	- practice how the subsystems of a game engine work.

- **Orthrus:** A new rendering project. I will do a deep study of **OpenGL** and **DirectX 12**. Orthrus is a 2 headed dog in Greek Mythology. I will practice more graphics concepts using both OpenGL and Direct3D.

- **Website:** I am trying to improve my internet presence. I started with a basic static website on github. For now I am learning the code I am running. In time, I will better tailor it for my taste.

- **Blender:** While using Blender, I am having the same thrill of creating things I have from game engines. I am not very good at it but I have fun. Also, it is a great shortcut to create assets.


## What I am lacking and trying to improve:
- I am still learning shaders and I want to be proficient with them more.
- I don't know how to use OpenGL and DirectX in a release mode. I only tinkered with them and I am trying to headbutt the problems of them and learn how to solve them before I come across them in a professional world.
- C++. I am proficient in it but I am trying to learn how to optimize and keep the readibility. Brevity is something I like to achieve with all the languages.
- Scripting Languages. Think of Javascript, Python and Powershell. I'd like to be able to express anything I want in a short time with them to create tools in a timely manner.
