<p>This is my first project. In the beginning, I started using Processing to visualize small game mechanics s.a. movement, jumping, and gravity. After a while, I decided to stop tinkering with Processing and create a game along the way.</p>

<p>I choose Tetris because I once read making Tetris, Breakout, Pacman, and Mario teach you the cores of video games. So I started with Tetris and made it in 3 days. It taught me a lot about the first bits.</p>

<p>I didn’t know what is Javascript at the time. However, I didn’t spend any time learning the language. I just learned what I need to do and used just that. That’s why the code is not perfect. But used my OOP paradigm to create some object structure. 
First I researched Tetris itself and learned it has quite the lore. After my journey with tetrominos, I made my object structure as follows.</p>

<p>First There is the <strong>Block</strong> which made a square on the screen:

<p>The second one is the <strong>tetrominos</strong> which is individual game pieces:
<img src="/assets/img/tetris/tetromino.png" alt="Z Tetromino" /></p>

<p>Last but not least there is <strong>Game</strong> which controls every game aspect:

<p>Here is a video of one of my test playthroughs:</p>
