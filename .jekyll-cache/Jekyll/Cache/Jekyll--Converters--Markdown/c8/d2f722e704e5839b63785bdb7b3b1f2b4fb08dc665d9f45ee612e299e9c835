I"<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Asturia, the best project in my life yet. This happened when I was playing around with OpenGL. OpenGL is the best thing I learned after the C programming language in computer engineering. Because it opened me lotâ€™s of information I wanted to consume. I am in love with how computers use math to create graphics. 20 minutes into my first OpenGL research, I decided to pursue a career around it.</p>

<p>Anyway, Asturia was created according to a task system. I try to use the divide and conquer method in every project I do. There is lotâ€™s of subtasks but in the big picture here are my goals about Asturia:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Box</li>
  <li>Different Boxes</li>
  <li>Selecting Boxes</li>
  <li>Box Chunks
    <ol>
      <li>Randomized Box Chunks</li>
      <li>Optimized Random Chunks (Biomes)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Save System</li>
  <li>Inventory System</li>
  <li>Different Objects to Use</li>
  <li>Craft System</li>
  <li>Enemies</li>
</ol>

<p>This is still my game goals list in the project and I admit it is a little mixed with my code goals list. I skipped 4.2 because it was over my head for that time. Shortly after that, I stopped working on this project entirely on task 5.</p>

<h1 id="process">Process</h1>

<p>I have 21 hours of footage. I recorded most of the time I spent on this project from the Premake creation to OpenGL research readings.</p>
<h2 id="file-systems">File Systems</h2>
<p>Since this part is not visual I will cut short. Before even creating my <em>main.c</em>, I created the git repository, merged required libraries and created the files required for Premake.</p>
<h2 id="opengl-end">OpenGL End</h2>

<p>After the necessary files, I needed to have a graphical environment. Thus I first created a triangle on the screen. Then I attached 2 triangles and created a square. After giving color to each pixel using their position I got this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/asturia/square1st.png" alt="An OpenGL Square with Color" /></p>

<h2 id="camera-movement">Camera Movement</h2>

<p>The camera movement is pretty straightforward. Since the screen canâ€™t move, just move everything around. But since there is lotâ€™s of math to do I had some bugs like these:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/asturia/weirdRot.png" alt="Rotating the OpenGL square issues" title="Rotating the OpenGL square issue" /></p>

<h2 id="cube-systems">Cube systems</h2>
<p>Then I tried to turn the square into a cube and rotate that. Note for future a box rotating vertically is weird without the perspective.</p>

<p>Here is a shot when the box didnâ€™t want to be a box:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/img/asturia/scatBox.png" alt="Scattered box picture" /></td>
      <td>â€”-</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And here is a box rotating vertically in front of you:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/asturia/notPerspecBox.png" alt="Ortho box rotation" /></p>

<p>But then I just studied the math behind it and suddenly all my coding problems went away too.
Here is a good looking box:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/asturia/boxColorful.png" alt="A real OpenGL Box" title="A Real OpenGL Box" />
Isnâ€™t it beautiful?</p>

<h2 id="textures">Textures</h2>
<p>After that, I dressed up my little box. First, it didnâ€™t want to wear anything. Then it wore a dirt texture and finally grass texture. I want to point out that the box is my limitation with aesthetics. I am a left-brain guy.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/img/asturia/boxBlack.png" alt="Black OpenGL Box" /></td>
      <td><img src="/assets/img/asturia/boxDirt.png" alt="Dirt OpenGL Box" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><img src="/assets/img/asturia/boxGrass.png" alt="Grass OpenGL Box" /></p>

<h2 id="skybox">Skybox</h2>

<p>This is not a big thing. But I realized with a skybox everything looked a little better. It made the game a whole.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/asturia/skybox.png" alt="Skybox" /></p>

<h2 id="box-chunks">Box Chunks</h2>
<p>As other programmers would know, If I can create one from one thing then I can create an <em>array</em> of the same thing.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/img/asturia/boxGrassArray.png" alt="An Array of Grass OpenGL Box" /></td>
      <td><img src="/assets/img/asturia/boxGrassArrayUp.png" alt="Array of Grass from Up" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>After that, I became curious about how to ray trace playerâ€™s selection. So I made a box removal task. Just to try out and it worked perfectly. Now I could draw on my game.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/asturia/mapeditor.png" alt="Map editing on OpenGL" /></p>

<p>But letâ€™s get real this is nothing compared to Minecraftâ€™s massive maps. So buckle up. After my floor of grass, I made some map generations.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/asturia/massGrass.png" alt="Big mass of Grass" /></p>

<p>But it was so massive it only had a couple of fps while rendering. And yes this is where I implemented <strong>fps counter</strong> as well. Because I needed a statistic about my performances. 
After a little playing around I found a better size for my chunks and I added render range. Render range helped me not to render the whole map.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/asturia/forestOfGrass.png" alt="Good fps forest of grass" /></p>

<p>Here is my diameter of rendering:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/asturia/dirtRange.png" alt="Dirt Range" /></p>

<p>Then, my imagination went wild.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/img/asturia/pyramidNormal.png" alt="pyramid of boxes" /></td>
      <td><img src="/assets/img/asturia/pyramidCrossed.png" alt="pyramid of boxes crossed" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In the end, I decided to go with this kind of a map style:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/asturia/themap.png" alt="Minecraft kind of a map with OpenGL" /></p>

<h2 id="map-generation">Map Generation</h2>

<p>I didnâ€™t like that my map is limited. So I made a map generation system. That created new chunks as I moved. There were some bugs at the beginning,</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/asturia/mapbug.png" alt="Map distortions" /></p>

<p>But it worked in the end.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/asturia/mapgen.png" alt="Alpha Map Generator" /></p>

<h2 id="save-system">Save System</h2>

<p>This is where I left my game. The save system is tricky and it needs the whole gameâ€™s system plans to work.</p>

<h1 id="result">Result</h1>

<p>This is how I fell in love with computer graphics. I love this project and maybe I will continue on this. But my main focus is now finishing a project and this one will never be finished. Because as original Minecraft, I can add new things all the time.</p>

<p>The video of this project may take a while. There is too much footage to edit.</p>

<p>I am not an OpenGL Guru but I will be glad to respond to any questions!</p>
