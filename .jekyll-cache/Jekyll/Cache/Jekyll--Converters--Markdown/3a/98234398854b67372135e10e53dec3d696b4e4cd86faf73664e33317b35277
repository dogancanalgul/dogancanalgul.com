 <h1> Who was I </h1>
On my 10th birthday, I have already planned to become a computer engineer. On my 16th birthday, I have already planned to become a part of a big game. I believe that will be how I will leave a mark on this world.

<h1> Who I want to be </h1> My career will be wrapped around the game industry. I want to be a game engine programmer. I am totally fine with continuing in another branch of game development. But in that case, I will still work on engines as a hobby.

<h1 id="now-what">Now what</h1>
<p>These days in my life, I am searching for an entry point to the game industry. In the meantime, I am working on several projects that will make me more qualified for the entry point while scratching my curiosity itches on game development.</p>
<h2 id="here-is-what-i-am-doing-these-days">Here is what I am doing these days:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unity Game Development:</strong> If you want to make a motor, you have to disassemble another motor. I am studying intermediate level Unity to;
    <ul>
      <li>make small games for game development experience in all areas of the game development process such as modeling level design, scripting.</li>
      <li>learn how the subsystems of a game engine work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Orthrus:</strong> A new rendering project. I will study <strong>OpenGL</strong> and <strong>DirectX 11</strong>. Orthrus is a 2 headed dog in Greek Mythology. I will learn graphics concepts using both OpenGL and Direct3D. This way I will be closer to industry standards.</li>
  <li><strong>Website:</strong> I am having presentation difficulties when I am discussing who I am and what I do. Thus I am trying to improve my internet presence. I started with a basic website but more will come.</li>
  <li><strong>Blender:</strong> While using Blender, I am having the same thrill of creating things I have from game engines. I am not successfull much but it is fun. Also, it is good to know how to create assets for unity.</li>
</ul>
