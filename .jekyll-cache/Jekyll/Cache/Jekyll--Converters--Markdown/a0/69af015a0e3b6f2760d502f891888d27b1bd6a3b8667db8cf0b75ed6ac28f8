<p>This project is on baby steps. The sole purpose of this project is to create an environment for learning machine learning. Thus, I and my friend <a href="https://github.com/SelmanOzleyen">Selman Ozleyen</a> created the Pong part to teach our machine learning scripts. Our tasks were simple and as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pong Game</li>
  <li>Player vs Player</li>
  <li>Player vs Bot created by our algorithm</li>
  <li>Player vs Bot created by machine learning</li>
  <li>Player vs Player over Internet</li>
</ul>

<p>But before we moved to 3rd task at hand, we got carried on. My friend had a tight schedule for a long time. However, this is still on my todo list and I am planning on implementing it soon.</p>

<p>The Pong is made with python and pygame. Each user has its racket, scoreboard, and net to count the goals.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot from the game:

<p>Here is a video of one of my test playthroughs:</p>

<p>Honestly, without the mentioned AI parts this project is not much. So stay tuned for updates and do not hesitate to contact me in any matter.</p>
